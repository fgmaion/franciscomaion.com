## Variance in Fixed & Paired Simulations

In 2020 I did a research internship with Prof. Ra√∫l Angulo at the DIPC, during which I managed to explain qualitatively why the variance of some statistical quantities derived from fixed-and-paired LSS simulations are reduced by this procedure, while others are not. Furthermore, I was able to derive mathematical expressions capable of predicting the value of these variances in the linear regime; these quantities were unknown prior to this work, and understanding their behaviour will help plan future simulation designed to reach a certain precision in these statistical quantities.
