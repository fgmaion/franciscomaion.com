In [Zennaro+FM (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.5443Z/abstract), we have employed our model of galaxy-clustering to fit a large number of galaxy populations with different clustering properties, thus obtaining priors on their bias parameters, which can be used in realistic analyses to limit their ranges. In [Maion+(2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JCAP...10..036M/abstract) we have systematically studied the effect of variance-reduction techniques on higher-order spectra computed
