## Variance in Fixed & Paired Simulations

Cosmological simulations play an increasingly important role in analysing the observed large-scale structure of the Universe.
Recently, they have been particularly important in building hybrid models that combine a perturbative bias expansion with displacement fields extracted from N-body simulations to describe the clustering of biased tracers.

In this project, we have shown that simulations employing a technique referred to as "Fixing-and-pairing" (F&P) can dramatically improve the statistical precision of such hybrid models. This is illustrated by figure (1), which shows the ratio between the variance of the relevant spectra in F&P and usual simulations. For certain spectra (i.e.: \(P_{11}\), \(P_{1\delta}\) and \(P_{\delta\delta}\) ), the variance is reduced by up to a factor of three orders of magnitude. 

Specifically, by numerical and analytical means, we have shown that F&P simulations provide unbiased estimates for all statistics employed by hybrid models while reducing, by up to two orders of magnitude, their uncertainty on large scales. 

This roughly implies that an EUCLID-like survey could be analysed using simulations of 2Gpc a side â€“ a 20% of the survey volume. Our work establishes the
robustness of F&P for current hybrid theoretical models for galaxy clustering, an important
step towards achieving an optimal exploitation of large-scale structure measurements.
