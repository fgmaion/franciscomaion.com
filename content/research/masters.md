# Constraining the matter growth-rate using VIPERS

During my masters I worked with spectroscopic surveys, mainly to develop an analysis pipeline inside the research group led by Prof. Raul Abramo. I implemented recipes to estimate the power spectra using optimal weights and correct these estimates for systematic distortions. I also wrote a code to compute the window function of the survey and incorporate its effects into the theoretical model for the power spectrum, in order to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters. I applied this pipeline to the public dataset of the VIPERS survey, obtaining constraints on the matter growth-rate at redshifts z=0.55, 0.7 and 0.9, which are shown in the figures below.
