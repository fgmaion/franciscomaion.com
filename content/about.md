Hello, I’m Francisco, a brazilian cosmologist currently doing my PhD at the Donostia International Physics Center. In my research, I aim to develop fast and accurate models for the large-scale structure of the universe using numerical simulations. 

 Outside of work I'm very enthusiastic about food, music, cinema, literature, and many other forms of cultural expression.

I also love travelling to places of natural beauty.
